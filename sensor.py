# Implementation of a class named Sensor that receives the following arguments:
# filename - the name of the file that contains the room information.
# The room is a grid of squares.
# Within the file, the first line contains the dimensions of the room.
# The second line contains the number of obstacles and their positions.
# The third line contains the number of treasures and their positions
# Example:
# 3 4
# 2 (1,1) (2,2) 
# 1 (0, 1)
# The room has 3 rows and 4 columns
# There are 2 obstacles in positions (1,1) and (2,2)
# There is 1 treasure in position (0,1)
#
# The class Sensor exposes the following methods:
# print_room() - prints the room
# with_obstacle(row, column) - returns True if the cell contains an obstacle, False otherwise
# with_treasure(row, column) - returns True if the cell contains a treasure, False otherwise
# n_treasures() - returns the number of treasures in the room
# dimensions() - returns the dimensions of the room
